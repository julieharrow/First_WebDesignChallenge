      <!Julie made the "Get Pre-Approved" button. Leads to input form on a different page. Would have liked to reduce the space before and increased the space after the button - heirarchies of css classes are not as familiar and I was unable to located the class that required change - inner-wrapper?>

<!Would have loved to have made the image boxes responsive so that when someone scrolls over the learnMoreIcons, they could preview some more details about those features- would have required making entire images and using jquery/javascript.>

  	<! Julie relocated the form to a separate page for simplicity.>
    <! Julie removed the 'About Us' section as it felt duplicative re: the About Us page through the nav bar.>
